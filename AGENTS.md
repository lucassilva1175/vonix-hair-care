- Catalog lives in src/data/products.json (prices already final); all price/installment/shipping rules are derived in src/lib/store.ts so they stay consistent everywhere.
- Store listings resolve the persisted audience independently of internal link search parameters; professional card presentation reuses lineTotals through cardPricing so catalog bases and cart offers remain unchanged.
- Header audience choices share the existing audience store; professional relevance sorts filtered results stably by catalog slug/category without changing offer eligibility, so manual sorting and commercial rules stay independent.
